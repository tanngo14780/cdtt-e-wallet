This is the source code for my graduation project in Information Technology. Specifically, it involves building an electronic wallet system and a payment system based on IoT technology for application at the National Economics University.

I have also included a docx file that contains a report on this system. With it, you can gain a better understanding of the system, including the database, system architecture, and the technologies used to develop the system.
